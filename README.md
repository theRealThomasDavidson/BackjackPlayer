# BackjackPlayer
should give optimal plays for blackjack overall and work as framework to figure out optimal betting. 


Poorly documented program that will use an exhaustive graph search with a stocatic model to predict 
optimal moves for blackjack.


If you came here from a company that is interested in hires. I usually try to have a plan, and keep documentation going, 
but I was playing new vegas and wondered about optimal blackjack stuff. so take away that I know how to do graph traversal 
even if finding successors is hard or the rules are different than a typical minmax or dykstra. Do not however feel that
this is how I plan to document all code I do. (this may be more or less relevent as time goes on and I do not update the
 readme)
